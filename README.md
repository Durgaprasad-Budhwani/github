## Requirements

You will need the following to build and run locally:

- [Pinpoint Agent SDK](https://github.com/pinpt/agent)
- [Golang](https://golang.org) 1.14+ or later
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) 12+ or later (only if modifying/running the Integration UI)

## Running Locally

You can run locally to test against a repo with the following command (assuming you already have the Agent SDK installed):

```
agent dev . --log-level=debug --set "apikey_auth={\"apikey\":\"$GITHUB_TOKEN\"}" --set 'inclusions={"pinpt":"pinpt/agent"}' --dir dist
```

Make sure you have the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` set to a GitHub personal access token.  You can also change repositories by updating the `inclusions` array.  The key in the map should be the `organization` login value.

This will run an export for GitHub and save the files to the directory specified by `--dist`.
